      <description>In recent years, the scale of large language models (LLMs) has expanded exponentially, transitioning from millions of parameters to billions. This growth has been accompanied by a significant shift towards multi-modal learning, which enhances the ability of LLMs to understand and generate various forms of data, including text, images, audio, and video. While these advancements improve the quality of outputs of LLMs, they also introduce considerable delays during the inference stage.</description>
